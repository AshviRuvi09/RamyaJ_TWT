# What is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface. In basic terms, APIs are a set of functions and procedures that allow for the creation of applications that access data and features of other applications, services, or operating systems.

## A real-world example
A real-world example is buying movie tickets online. You go to the movie site; you enter your movie, name and credit card information, and lo-and-behold, you print out your tickets.

But what’s going on between entering your information to receiving your ticket? APIs, that’s what! They are collaborating behind the scenes with other applications.

How is this possible you ask? This type of integration is called “seamless” because you never have a clue when a software role is passed from one application to another.

## Why do we need an API?
Imagine the following scenario: You (as in, your application, or your client, say a web browser or mobile app) wants to access another app’s data or functionality.

For example, perhaps you want to access all Twitter tweets that mention the #jimmychoo hashtag.
