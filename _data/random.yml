API file Names:
-Kernel-level API: The API is "kernel-level" when the kernel not only provides the interfaces for the filesystems developers but is also the space in which the filesystem code resides.With modular kernels it allows adding filesystems as any kernel module, even third party ones. With non-modular kernels however it requires the kernel to be recompiled with the new filesystem code (and in closed-source kernels, this makes third party filesystem impossible).
